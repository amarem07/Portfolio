# 🛡️ Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning  
### **XGBoost · PCA · Feature Engineering · Model Optimization**

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify phishing URLs using lexical features, domain attributes, and structural patterns. The dataset contains **11,055 URLs** with **88 engineered features** extracted directly from each URL string.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Phishing websites impersonate legitimate businesses to steal information from users. This project uses machine learning to classify URLs as **phishing** or **legitimate** based purely on URL-level features—no HTML scraping required.

This makes the model fast, lightweight, and deployable in real-time.

## 📊 Dataset Description

**Dataset Size:** 11,055 URLs  
**Features:** 88 engineered attributes including:
- URL length, digit count, special character count  
- HTTPS presence  
- TLD analysis  
- Subdomain depth  
- Suspicious patterns (e.g., “@”, “//”, “-”)  
- Domain age, expiration, registrar fields  

**Target:**  
- `0` = legitimate  
- `1` = phishing
