## 👋 About Me
I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with experience in predictive modeling, deep learning, regression analysis, and large-scale data workflows. With a strong background in financial systems, QA automation, and end-to-end ML pipelines, I enjoy turning complex datasets into actionable insights and production-ready models.  
Currently completing my **Master of Science in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at Boston University**.

I specialize in:
- Machine Learning (XGBoost, PCA, SVM, Random Forest, CNNs)
- Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, EDA
- Deep Learning & Computer Vision
- Model Optimization, Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning
- SQL, Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- Power BI dashboards and data automation workflows
